# ESP-automated-indicators
Code to automate ESP Satellite SST indicators within the AKFIN database

As of 2021, there were four ESP indicators calculated from SST stored in AKFIN
-Spring_Temperature_Surface_EGOA_Satellite: "Late spring (May-June) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the eastern GOA (NMFS areas 640 and 650, no depth restriction) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring Product Suite Version 3.1, derived from CoralTemp v1.0. product (NOAA Coral Reef Watch, 2018), 1985 to present.\r\n\r\nCode available at: https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators"
-Spring_Temperature_Surface_WCGOA_Satellite: "Spring (April-May) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the western and central GOA (combined over the 10m-200m shelf for NMFS areas 610, 620, 630) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring Product Suite Version 3.1, derived from CoralTemp v1.0. product (NOAA Coral Reef Watch, 2018). The data are served through the ERDDAP maintained by NOAA CoastWatch West Coast Regional Node and Southwest Fisheries Science Center's Environment Research Division. Available from 1985 to present.\r\n\r\nCode available at: https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators"
-Spring_Temperature_Surface_SEBS_Satellite: "Late spring (May-June) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the southeastern Bering Sea (deeper than 10 m) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring Product Suite Version 3.1, derived from CoralTemp v1.0. product (NOAA Coral Reef Watch, 2018), 1985 to present.\r\n\r\nCode available at: https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators" 
-Spring_Summer_Temperature_Surface_SEBS_Satellite: "Spring to summer (April-June) daily sea surface temperatures (SST) on a 5 km grid averaged over the southeastern Bering sea (10 m to shelf break (200 m) south of 60 degN) (Watson, 2020) from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program which provides the Global 5km Satellite Coral Bleaching Heat Stress Monitoring Product Suite Version 3.1, derived from CoralTemp v1.0. product (NOAA Coral Reef Watch, 2018). The data are served through the ERDDAP maintained by NOAA CoastWatch West Coast Regional Node and Southwest Fisheries Science Center's Environment Research Division.

code for calculating these exists on Jordan Watson's github: https://github.com/jordanwatson/ESP_Indicators

We replicate these calculations in the esp_indicator.sql file
